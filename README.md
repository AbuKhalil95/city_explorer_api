# city_explorer_api
An exercise in building a server API for city explorer.  


**Author**: Yahya Abu Khalil
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
The application would help setup an API node where we could call for information from the users and display them in a "frontend", a learning experience on how to navigate data in between.

The application also provides essential data on each location, these data shows the weather, hiking trail, yelp reviews and movie databases for tourists and outgoing locals alike!

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
[Follow the link to the front-end](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/).
add this link to it (https://abukhalil-city-explorer-api.herokuapp.com). And start searching!

If you'd want a map for each location, make an account in [LocationIQ](https://my.locationiq.com/dashboard/login?ref=locationiq), get the token API and enter it within the app for geocoding map.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Using Javsscript and Nodejs server files, Heroku for deployment, PostgreSQL for persistent database. 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples: -->
